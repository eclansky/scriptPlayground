#pycs 1.5, 1.6 Lists, dictionaries

#note that dictionaries use curlies instead of [] normal brackets like in an array[list]
#each item has single quotes like a list would, but the two 'strings' are
# These are key:value pairs , each key has a differnet value
slang = {'cheerio':'goodbye', 'knackered':'tired'}
# Lets add an item to our dictionary
# dict name['key'] = 'value'
slang['oinks'] = 'goodbye'
